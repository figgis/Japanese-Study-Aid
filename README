OK, lets face it, Japanese is hard!
So I figured I need to collect stuff into a format that allows me to
practice on the bus, train, while watching TV, drinking beer and so
on. 

First attempt was made using sphinx and python. The html-looks great
but the latex/pdf-generation failed due to that sphinx doesn't
support multi-row-columns; big show stopper!

Second attempt (this one) generates LaTeX-directly and the output
looks, well perhaps not perfect, but its a start at least and it
allows me to bring the printed version with me; I can even cut out
the different tables and use them as Q-cards...

./python
    mt.py
    short for MakeTable, main program that generates
    LaTeX-tables. 

    create_jpn_db.py
    which contains an array with all verbs and adjectives and their
    conjugations.

    create_i_adj.py
    helper function to automatically generate i-adjective from the
    stem of the word.

    latex_template.py
    well, the templates

    generate doc with:
    $ xelatex try.tex

./doc
    jpn.pdf
    the generated document

generate doc with:
$./mt.py > jpn.tex
$ xelatex jpn.tex

TODO (in no particular order)
=============================
* Add more verbs/adjectives etc.
* Clean up the messy structure
* Auto-generate conjugation for as much as possible instead of
  writing it by hand!
* Some more clever latex trix to generate a Q-card that when
  folded in the middle contains the kanji/kana dictionary form
  and on the other side the conjugations
