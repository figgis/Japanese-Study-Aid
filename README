OK, lets face it, Japanese is hard!
So I figured I need to collect stuff into a format that allows me to
practice on the bus, train, while watching TV, drinking beer and so
on. 

First attempt was made using sphinx and python. The html-looks great
but the latex/pdf-generation failed due to that sphinx doesn't
support multi-row-columns; big show stopper!

Second attempt (this one) generates LaTeX-directly and the output
looks, well perhaps not perfect, but its a start at least and it
allows me to bring the printed version with me; I can even cut out
the different tables and use them as Q-cards...

The file-structure is a chaotic mix of sphinx and LaTeX right now,
hopefully that will change soon :-)

./ 
contains sphinx-stuff, the *.rst-files, obsolete sort of...

./python
    mt.py
    short for MakeTable, main program that generate both
    sphinx-tables as well as LaTeX-dito. Using data.pkl provided by...

    create_jpn_db.py
    which contains an array with all verbs and adjectives and their
    conjugations.

    create_i_adj.py
    helper function to automatically generate i-adjective from the
    stem of the word.

    data.pkl
    pickled db

./latex
    try.tex
    LaTeX template. The output from mt.py basically goes in between
    \begin{document} and \end{document}

    generate doc with:
    $ xelatex try.tex

./doc
    jpn.pdf
    the generated document

TODO (in no particular order)
=============================
* Add more verbs/adjectives etc.
* Clean up the messy structure
* Automate the latex generation
* Auto-generate conjugation for as much as possible instead of
  writing it by hand!
* Fix the .encode('utf-8') mess ie. as in create_i_adj.py
* Some more clever latex trix to generate a Q-card that when
  folded in the middle contains the kanji/kana dictionary form
  and on the other side the conjugations
