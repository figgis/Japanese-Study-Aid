OK, lets face it, Japanese is hard!
So I figured I need to collect stuff into a format that allows me to
practice on the bus, train, while watching TV, drinking beer and so
on.

First attempt was made using sphinx and python. The html-looks great
but the latex/pdf-generation failed due to that sphinx doesn't
support multi-row-columns; big show stopper!

Second attempt (this one) generates LaTeX-directly and the output
looks, well perhaps not perfect, but its a start at least and it
allows me to bring the printed version with me; I can even cut out
the different tables and use them as flash-cards...

generate doc with:
$ cd python
$ make
$ make view
